HI this is a test file to commit and then uncommit this file from local.

here i am done with successful 
1. git reset --hard HEAD^ to undo local commit before pushing the code to remote.
2. git commit -a -m "message" to commit the changes in local.
3. git push -u origin <branchname> to push the commit to remote branch.
